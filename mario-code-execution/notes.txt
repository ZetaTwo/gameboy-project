uh, as I recall I could get small data near the stack and pivot the stack to that data and then you had to alter a value used for an offset twice (going through the whole process again) and then finally use that small data as a partial trampoline, or there was a 32byte area where the bytes were rotated and you could keep flipping values there to get an arb write and then you could flip values in the zero page to fuck with mem registers
